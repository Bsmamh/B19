        "recipeText": "This vibrant dough cooks into beautifully tender, chewy noodles. A lot of love (and arm strength) goes into making your own fresh pasta, but the result is absolutely worth it. This dough is perfect for noodles, but can also be used in lasagna or filled pasta like ravioli or tortellini. Since so much love is going into the dough, we think it's best to let it shine and use simple sauces to help highlight the flavour of the pasta itself."
